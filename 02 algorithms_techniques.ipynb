    "Python offers a versatile and intuitive platform for implementing a wide range of algorithm techniques. In this notebook, we've demonstrated several key methods:\n",

    "- Binary search (both iterative and recursive) illustrates an efficient way to locate elements in a sorted list.\n",
    "- Binary trees and Binary Search Trees (BST) highlight hierarchical data structures that underpin many complex algorithms.\n",
    "- Greedy algorithms, BFS, and DFS are explored in the context of graph traversal and problem solving.  \n",
    "- Graph-related algorithms, including the check for a valid tree, show how systematic approaches can ensure the correctness of tree and network structures.\n",

    "## Recursion and Iteration\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself with a subset of its original problem. This is especially useful for problems that have a naturally recursive structure, such as tree traversals, factorial computations, and the Fibonacci sequence. A recursive approach typically includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "• A clear base case that stops further recursive calls.  \n",
    "• A reduction step, where the problem size is decreased with each recursive call.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, calculating the factorial of a number using recursion involves multiplying the number by the factorial of one less than the number until reaching 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration, on the other hand, uses looping constructs (such as for and while loops) to repeat a block of code until a condition is met. This method is often easier to understand when the number of iterations is clearly determined before the loop starts or can be computed on the fly. Iterative solutions can be more memory efficient because they avoid the overhead of multiple function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches have their strengths: recursion can lead to more elegant and concise code for problems with a recursive nature, while iteration can be more efficient in terms of performance and resource usage when handling simple loops.\n",

    "Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function performs one recursive call per decrement of n, which makes the time complexity linear, O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**  \n",
    "The space complexity is also O(n) due to the depth of the recursion (because Python uses a call stack to keep track of each recursive call).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x^{n} = x \\times x^{n-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Negative Exponents:**  \n",
    "- If n is negative, we want to compute the power as the reciprocal. For instance, $ x^{-3} = \\frac{1}{x^3} $.  \n",
    "- The code does this by setting $ x = \\frac{1}{x} $ and turning n into a positive value with `n = -n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:**  \n",
    "- `result` is set to 1.0. This variable will accumulate the answer.  \n",
    "- The loop starts and repeatedly checks the current exponent n.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exponentiation by Squaring Loop:**  \n",
    "- **When n is odd:**  \n",
    "    The expression `if n & 1:` tests whether the least-significant bit of n is 1 (i.e., whether n is odd).  \n",
    "    If n is odd, we multiply the current result by x because an odd exponent can be written as $ x^{n} = x \\times x^{n-1} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Squaring Step:**  \n",
    "    In every iteration, we square x. This updates x to be $ x^2 $, then $ x^4 $, $ x^8 $, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dividing the Exponent:**  \n",
    "    The exponent n is halved using `n //= 2`, removing the bit that has been processed.  \n",
    "    This halving reduces the number of iterations to roughly $ \\log_2(n) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Termination and Return:**  \n",
    "- The loop terminates when n becomes 0. At that point, the variable `result` contains the computed power.  \n",
    "- Finally, `result` is returned."

    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth-first search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that starts at a given source node and explores all its neighboring nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. The typical steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Initialize a queue with the starting node.  \n",
    "• Repeatedly dequeue the front node, process it (which could involve incrementing a counter like \"count\" or keeping track using an index \"i\"), and enqueue its non-visited neighbors.  \n",
    "• Continue until the queue is empty, ensuring that all nodes reachable from the source have been visited level by level.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach guarantees that the algorithm visits nodes in the order of their distance from the start, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. Additionally, if your algorithm needs to process groups or ranges of elements (such as the \"intervals\" list), these can be incorporated during the traversal to handle node grouping or to perform specific interval-related logic.\n",
